  Problem: Leetcode 759 Employee Free Time (Hard)
  We are given a list of employees, where each employee has a list of non-overlapping intervals that represent their working hours.
  The intervals for each employee are sorted. Return a list of finite intervals representing free time for all employees,
  i.e., the time intervals where no one is working.
  
  Example:
  Input: schedule = [[[1, 2], [5, 6]], [[1, 3]], [[4, 10]]]
  Output: [[3, 4]]
  Explanation: There are total 3 employees, and all common free time would be [-inf, 1], [3,4], [10, inf].
  We discard intervals as they aren't finite.
